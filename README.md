I am Samiksha. I am currently a year 1 student studying Computer Science and Economics (double degree) at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore).  This is an ongoing project to create my own personal website.

# Resources used
Original codes were taken from startbootstrap.com/themes
The theme was called Agency
It was then modified to my own personal preferences.

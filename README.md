# S-Samiksha.github.io
I am Samiksha. I am currently a Year 2 Student studying a double degree in Computer Science and Economics at Nanyang Technological University(Singapore).

This website was built in May 2021. Posts here are updated accordingly. This website is built using Jekyll. 

I took inspiration from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency. 
Thereafter, I editted it to suit my preferences. Finally, I had to integrate it with Jekyll to create a static site.

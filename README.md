# S-Samiksha.github.io
I am Samiksha. I am currently a Year 1 Student studying a double degree in Computer Science and Economics at Nanyang Technological University(Singapore). I will be embarking on my second year this coming August. 

This website was made using HTML, CSS, Jekyll and Github Pages.

Design taken from: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency. 

I editted it to suit my preferences. Then, I integrated it with Jekyll to create a static site.

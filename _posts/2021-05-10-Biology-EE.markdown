### Introduction
Recently, increasing rates of cancer is the leading cause of death. However, the current medicine given to treat cancer like chemotherapy has many side effects like nausea and pain. In India, the Neem plant is an herb believed to cure cancer and even prevent relapses. However, laboratory researches show that excessive amounts of neem can cause adverse effects. I was curious to find out if this was true, what amount of neem would be just right to prevent cancer while minimising adverse effects. Research has shown high Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can cause cancer by causing genotoxicity and DNA damage. J. Spencer et al. showed more DNA stand breaks with increasing concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Hence, I decided to investigate how neem prevents oxidative damage caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

This research was conducted as part of my IBDP studies. I had done this research project over two years, spending November and Deceber 2018 to collect the data. Preliminary Trials were done in June 2018. Here is the research question:


### Research Question
How does the concentration of Azadirachta indica (neem) leaf extract (0.000, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008 and 0.010 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) without or with 50cm<sup>3</sup> of 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) affect the Mitotic Index (MI) and the abnormal mitotic index(A-MI) in the root tips of Allium cepa, the duration of the experiment (24h), the species of the onion used (Allium cepa var. aggregatum), and the initial root length of the onion (1 inch) the same?


### Methodology
To investigate the research question above, onion roots were soaked in two different types of solutions:
1. Neem only at the different concentrations stated
2. Neem at the different concentrations with a fixed amount of Hydrogen Peroxide

Mitotic Index is the number of cells under going mitosis (division of the DNA into two daughter cells) divided by the number of total cells observed. Abnormal Mitosis happens when the cell division is dysfunctional and causes asymmetric division of the DNA in the cells. After collecting the data, ANOVA tests and Tukey test were done. 

ANOVA Test allows us to see if there is any significant difference in the mitotic index/abnormal mitotic index between independent variables in this case the concentration of Neem. However, it does not allow us to tell between which independent variable is the significant difference present. As such, a Tukey test has to be done to test exactly where the significant difference lies. 

Linear reletionships are not common. Sometimes, we see a linear relationship in a certain range of independent variables. Other times, we see quadratic, exponential or other forms of relationships. In the case of my research, linear relationship was not the best way to analyse the data I had. The range at which there was a linear relationship between independent and dependent variable was small. 
Additionally, it was difficult to measure whether there was a statistically significant change in the mitotic index when the concentration of neem was changed.

### Findings
Hence, the ANOVA and Tukey test were run. After which, conclusions were drawn. Detailed analysis are provided in the cited pdf below. 
In summary, through this research it was found out that:
1. In the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as the concentration of neem increases, both the Mitotic Index and Abnormal Mitotic Index fall. 
2. In the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, there is no significant difference in the fall of Abnormal Mitotic Index as   concentration of neem increases
3. In the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as the concentration of neem increases, both the Mitotic Index and Abnormal Mitotic Index fall. 
4. As the concentration of neem increases, the Mitotic Index in the set-up with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreases to a less extent compared to the Mitotic Index in set-up without H2O2
5. As the concentration of neem increases, Abnormal Mitotic Index for the set-up with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreases with a     larger extent compared to the Abnormal Mitotic Index in set-up without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
6. To add on, the Abnormal Mitotic Index is higher than the Mitotic Index in both set-ups without or with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

### Reflections and Learning Points
**Preliminary Trials**<br>
One problem encountered was that the Allium cepa roots were left in neem and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> too long causing a plateau and insignificant results after 3 days of treatment. Keeping the onions too long also resulted in the onions growing fungus. Hence I decided to shorten my experiment to collect data at 24h to ensure significant results. There was trouble of finding perfect containers, in the lab. Finding the right size of containers was difficult so I decided to use plastic containers. Moreover, 6% H2O2 was too concentrated and it dissolved the nucleus completely, meaning no significant comparisons in ANOVA tests and Tukey Tests could be obtained. Hence I decided to halve the concentration to 3% to obtained significant results. 

**Dfficulties before the experiment**<br>
This project required a lot of dedication. One challenge for this project was to grow the onion roots. For this project, I needed 10 replicates for 12 independent variables. This meant that 120 onions had to be grown with roots long enough for the project. Only after the roots are long enough, I could use them for the experiment. Most of the time the onion roots would not grow. Other times they would have fungus growing on them. It took a lot of time and dedication to simply grow the onions. 

**Difficulties during the experiment**<br>
Another problem I faced was the fact that the experiment had a turn over time of 24 hours. This meant that I had to soak the roots in the respective solutions for 24 hours before I collected data. Out of 10 replicates, only 7 was collected during my holidays. This meant I had 3 replicated multiplied by 12 independent variables left to conduct experiments on. It was difficult to work around my school timetable to make sure 24 hours was exactly followed. Through this I learnt how to plan well and work around constraints that I had.

While doing the report and counting the cells for mitotic index, I learnt how to persevere to count a large amount of data. I had to count the cells in 120 images. i had to be efficient in order to finish counting and do my other projects, homeworks and assignments.

I also realized that mitotic index may not be all-encompassing  because other forms of abnormalities like apoptosis was visible but this would not be counted under the Mitotic Index. It was through this that I learnt the mechanisms that lead to such abnormalities and how H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and neem affects the chemical structure DNA and how it mediates cascade reactions in the cell. If I were to continue the research, I would do the cometâ€™s assay which uses gel electrophoresis to separate DNA and analyse genotoxicity. 

**An experience I will remember**<br>
I had given my best in this project and learnt a lot. I was really glad and felt blessed to have done well for this project.

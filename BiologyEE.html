                    Recently, increasing rates of cancer is the leading cause of death. However, the current medicine given to treat cancer like chemotherapy has many 
                    side effects like nausea and pain. In India, the Neem plant is an herb believed to cure cancer and even prevent relapses. However,
                    laboratory researches show that excessive amounts of neem can cause adverse effects. I was curious to find out if this was true, 
                    what amount of neem would be just right to prevent cancer while minimising adverse effects.
                    Research has shown high Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can cause cancer by causing genotoxicity and DNA damage. J. Spencer et al. showed more DNA stand 
                    breaks with increasing concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
                    Hence, I decided to investigate how neem prevents oxidative damage caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     This research was conducted as part of my IBDP studies. I had done this research project over two years, spending November and Deceber 2018 to collect the data. 
                     Preliminary Trials were done in June 2018. Here is the research question: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    How does the concentration of Azadirachta indica (neem) leaf extract (0.000, 0.002, 0.004,
                    0.006, 0.008 and 0.010 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
                    ) without or with 50cm<sup>3</sup>
                    of 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) affect
                    the Mitotic Index (MI) and the abnormal mitotic index(A-MI) in the root tips of Allium cepa,
                    the duration of the experiment (24h), the species of the onion used (Allium cepa var.
                    aggregatum), and the initial root length of the onion (1 inch) the same?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To investigate the research question above, onion roots were soaked in two different types of solutions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Neem only at the different concentrations stated</li>
                            <li>Neem at the different concentrations with a fixed amount of Hydrogen Peroxide</li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mitotic Index is the number of cells under going mitosis (division of the DNA into two daughter cells) divided by the number of total cells observed. 
                    Abnormal Mitosis happens when the cell division is dysfunctional and causes asymmetric division of the DNA in the cells. 
                    After collecting the data, ANOVA tests and Tukey test were done. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    ANOVA Test allows us to see if there is any significant difference in the mitotic index/abnormal mitotic index between 
                    independent variables in this case the concentration of Neem. However, it does not allow us to tell between which independent variable is the significant difference present. 
                    As such, a Tukey test has to be done to test exactly where the significant difference lies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linear reletionships are not common. 
                    Sometimes, we see a linear relationship in a certain range of independent variables. Other times, we see quadratic, exponential or other forms of relationships. 
                    In the case of my research, linear relationship was not the best way to analyse the data I had. 
                    The range at which there was a linear relationship between independent and dependent variable was small. 
                    Additionally, it was difficult to measure whether there was a statistically significant change in the mitotic index when the concentration of neem was changed.
                </p>
                    Hence, the ANOVA and Tukey test were run. After which, conclusions were drawn. Detailed analysis are provided in the cited pdf below. 
                    In summary, through this research it was found out that:
                    <ul>
                        <li> In the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as the concentration of neem increases, both the Mitotic Index and Abnormal Mitotic Index fall. </li>
                        <li> In the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, there is no significant difference in the fall of Abnormal Mitotic Index as
                            concentration of neem increases </li>
                        <li> In the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as the concentration of neem increases, both the Mitotic Index and Abnormal Mitotic Index fall. </li>
                        <li> As the concentration of neem increases, the Mitotic Index in the set-up with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreases to a less extent compared to the Mitotic Index in set-up without H2O2</li>
                        <li> As the concentration of neem increases, Abnormal Mitotic Index for the set-up with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreases with a 
                            larger extent compared to the Abnormal Mitotic Index in set-up without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></li>
                        <li>To add on, the Abnormal Mitotic Index is higher than the Mitotic Index in both set-ups without or with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
